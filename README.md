### Amplify Web Embed

[Indivisible SF](http://www.indivisiblesf.org/) is making activism more approachable and manageable by offering clear calls to action and encouragement for completing them with a simple mobile app: Amplify. 

We are helping to AMPLIFY the reach of Amplify, by adding a web widget with the best features of the mobile app, to users who do not/cannot use mobile phones. This widget can be used by third parties to expand the reach of Amplify to more activist groups.

This Widget was built by [Thelma Boamah](https://github.com/thelmaboamah), [Chelsea Mangold](https://github.com/narriteration), and [Emily Johnson](https://github.com/ladydangerdame) at the Ctrl Alt Del Hate Hackathon hosted by [AngelHack](http://angelhack.com/) and [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) **where it was the winning project!**
